I listen to a lot of podcasts every day, e.g. when doing chores or commuting. 
One of the shows I particulary enjoy recently is 
[Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex), where Myke Hurley and CGP Grey talk about
their ways to be productive.
Every year, they define yearly themes, which are a bit like new year's 
resolutions, but instead of hard targets, they are more like directions in which 
you want to go. 
I highly recommend listening to the 
[Yearly Themes Episode of 2019](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/79).

Since this is such a good idea, I naturally defined my own yearly themes for 
2019. 
One of those is called _Year of automation_, which to me means automating 
everything I can in my private as well as professional life.

I will try and documente all bigger efforts (you don't want to see all my email 
rules) in this blog series.
You will find all episodes under the tag [automate](/tags/automate).
